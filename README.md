# Mobile App Data Analysis Project

Welcome to the Mobile App Data Analysis project! In this guided project, we'll combine various skills to perform practical data analysis. 

## Project Overview

We've all learned about different topics in isolation, but this project aims to bring together those skills to solve a real-world problem. 

Imagine yourself as a data analyst for a company that specializes in building Android and iOS mobile apps. These apps are distributed through Google Play and the App Store, with the main revenue stream coming from in-app advertisements. The number of users directly impacts the revenue generated from these ads. Hence, understanding the factors that attract more users is crucial for the company's success.

## Project Goals

Our goal for this project is to analyze data and provide insights to help developers understand what type of apps are likely to attract more users. By doing so, we aim to optimize app development strategies and ultimately increase user engagement and revenue.
